This is a fun "Whack A Pig" game where you click on bouncing piggy targets to score points! Targets appear randomly and grow or shrink while on-screen. The goal is to hit as many pigs as possible before your 30 lives (misses) run out. The game tracks your speed, accuracy, and hits while showing stats on a cute top bar. If you run out of lives, an end screen displays your performance. 

It’s all built using **Pygame** with quirky pig images, a dynamic background, and smooth animations, ensuring an exciting, fast-paced gaming experience. 

Whack away those mischievous pigs! 🐷🎯
